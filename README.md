<h1 align="center" id="title">Map Navigator</h1>

<p id="description">The Map Navigator Project is a Java-based application that calculates the shortest path between two geographic locations using a graph-based approach. By taking latitude and longitude inputs from the user the project identifies the nearest points on a pre-built graph (such as a highway network) calculates the optimal route between the points and visualizes the path on a map. The project leverages graph processing algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently compute the shortest route. It is designed for use with a dataset that contains geographic information such as a road network graph for a specific country (e.g. the USA). The program also supports visualizing the computed route on a background map giving users a clear visual representation of their calculated path. This tool can be used in various applications including route planning geographic analysis and transportation network optimization. Future expansions could include support for additional geographic locations real-time map updates or the integration of more sophisticated algorithms to handle diverse transportation networks.</p>
